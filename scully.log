      The config file should have a name that is formated as:
          scully.<projectName>.config.ts
      where <projectName> is the name of the project as defined in the 'angular.json' file
      If you meant to build a different project as undefined you can use:
          --project differentProjectName as a cmd line option

      When you are in a mixed mono-repo you might need to use the --pjFirst flag.
       which will look for package.json instead of angular.json to find the 'root' of the project.

The option outDir isn't configured, using default folder ".\dist\static\".No routes defined in ""



We encountered a problem while reading the routes from your applications source.
This might happen when there are lazy-loaded routes, that are not loaded,
Or when there are paths we can not resolve statically.
Check the routes in your app, rebuild and retry.
(You can inspect the error by passing the --showGuessError flag

When there are extraRoutes in your config, we will still try to render those.
